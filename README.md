ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence

## ðŸ˜„ About me 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Work and Organizational Psychology from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Driven by a desire to bridge the domains of cutting-edge technology and human understanding, I aspire to craft meaningful solutions in Machine Learning and Data Analytics. My blend of expertise motivates me to keep humanity at the heart of innovation while developing state-of-the-art technology. Currently, I am working on conventional and interactive reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ”­ Current projects

I am working on prosody-sensitive interactive reinforcement learning. This enables a person to train a reinforcement learning agent live with their voice to complete the Frozen Lake task offered by gym.
